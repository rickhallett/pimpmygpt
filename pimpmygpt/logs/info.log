Are there aspects of frontend work that are uniquely human and resistant to AI automation?\\r\\n   \\r\\n2. In what ways might AI assist backend developers, perhaps by optimizing databases or ensuring code efficiency? Could the intricacies and unpredictabilities of backend systems limit the effectiveness of AI automation in this area?\\r\\n\\r\\n3.
